## Introduction

SQL is a standard language for interacting with relational databases. This repository is designed to introduce you to the basics of SQL, including how to create databases, manage tables, and perform queries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have:

- Basic understanding of databases and their purposes.
- MySQL installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of SQL and relational databases.
- Create and manage databases and tables.
- Insert, update, delete, and query data using SQL.
- Understand basic SQL functions and operators.
- Use constraints and indexes.
